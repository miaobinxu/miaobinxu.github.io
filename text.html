        <div id = "critism">Almost in the same period of time, I was acquainted with Huang Ming, Fan Bo and Lei Bo. Five years ago, Huang Ming was a neighbor of Fan Bo when he lived in Beijing. So, if I visited one of them, the other one would be called to join the gathering. It was interesting to discover although they had totally different personality and style of painting, they had one single commonality in the form of expression, which gave me the deepest impression. Their paintings showed two core elements.  In many paintings of Fan, you would see a withered tree and a man under the tree; while in many of Huangâ€™s paintings, you would see an aged object and a straw mat underneath. <p></p>It can be said that the aged object and mat appeared in almost all of Huang paintings. Speaking of his painting, one will inevitably think of these two core elements.</div>

        <div id = "interview">Inevitably, everyone will keep something in his memory. Some are sadness, some are joys, some are special objects and some are people with special meanings.  If you have a pleasant life now, perhaps you are busy consuming the happiness at the moment, but have little time to deal with memory-related stuffs. If you have a hard time now, as an instinct, you would be willing to recall your memories to water down current difficulties or bad mood and relish your old days of happiness and beauty.  Some say, enjoying the present is a privilege of young people and the elderly are more likely to recall. In fact, it is not always the case. Living environment and social background of people can always affect their choice.</div>

        <div id = "essay">During the 30 years of reform and opening up, China has gone through a rapid economic development, through which people can now enjoy a more materialistic life with higher living standards. However, in the process of developing market economy, money worship has spread to all areas, so human desires keep expanding while human spirits are weakening and their sense of happiness is lacking. Recently, a survey conducted by a foreign agency reveals that the pressures faced by Chinese wage earners last year rank number one in the world, such as huge population, social transformation, materialistic desire expansion and unfair distribution. Under such pressures, even younger people lack the capital for happiness, too. In a period of social transformation, China is facing a reconstruction of social core system and moral system, so it is normal for people to feel the pressures. Ignoring current troubles and puzzles and comforting the mind by recalling memories have become a free method of psychological decompression for many people. Mental confusion and imbalance have encouraged many people to recall the old times unwittingly. </div>
